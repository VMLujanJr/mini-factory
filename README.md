# RULES
1. Create __feature branches__ by pulling from the most up-to-date `develop` branch.
2. Merge *functional* __feature branches__ to `develop` branch (no broken code).
3. Add __simple comments__, keep it short.
4. Work in __Live Share__ whenever possible to avoid __merge conflicts__.
5. If your code is broken, __STOP__, attempt to remedy the situation *and* __DO NOT__ merge or push your code to the repository until it is resolved.
